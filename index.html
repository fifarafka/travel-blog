          <img src="img/heida_profilowe.png" class="profile_photo"> I’m 26 years old, an American, self-proclaimed ice cream Addict with a capital A, and reveler in the feels of having absolutely no idea what is going on around me.
          </br>
          </br>
          My story began on the east coast of the US, where I lived until 2013. No crazy origin stories here—my life was pretty straightforward, but I was lucky to have a family who encouraged travel from day 1 (though they’re still telling me to come back and
          get a “real job” these days).
          </br>
          </br>
          One half of my family is Filipino, the other half English, so living in the States meant growing up amongst a trifecta of cultures, and my parents didn’t stop there. Summer vacations always included adventures such as choking on yak hairs my milk on the
          Mongolian steppe, being sprayed in the face by unnecessarily advanced toilets in Japan, and crunching on fried centipedes-on-a-stick on the street markets of China.
          </br>
          </br>
          After graduating with a degree in Fancytalk and Politically Correct BS from an Esteemed Institution of Pretentious Learnings in 2013, I transplanted myself and two suitcases over to the Netherlands so I could bask in the presence of inhumanly tall people
          and uncreative fried foods.
          </br>
          </br>
          While in the Netherlands, I honed my design skills, and learned how to make websites and software marginally less painful to use. Sweet useful, usable things!

          those days I looked outside my window and saw sad, gray skies and endless Dutch rain. The days full of wondrous adventure and mischief will be where my mind will doubtlessly wander.
          </br>
          </br>
          As a 28-year-old who has been on several backpacking adventures and other worldly escapades, I thought I would settle down a bit after I finished university. You know, find a nice job, make some money, the normal stuff a business graduate thinks off when
          he goes into the final stretch of his studies.
          </br>
          </br>
          Fate, it seems, had different plans.
          </br>
          </br>
          I met Alex, and we ended up living together. Living with a girl so full of wanderlust made it all but impossible to think about anything but the wide open world. Future “adult” plans were thrown out the window. Through savings and some small investments,
          we set enough money aside to start a new journey (although I might need to live as a bum if we ever settle down).
